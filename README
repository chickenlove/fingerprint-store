fingerprint-store
=================

This tool is meant as a helper script to MusicBrainz Picard [1] or Acoustid
Fingerprinter [2]. When using these programs to submit new fingerprints, they
generally can't return and store a track id into the file tags, since they have
to be generated first (which usually takes up to one hour). With this script it
is possible to easily do this later. Also supports MusicDNS PUID.
